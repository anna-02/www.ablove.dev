My name is Anna Ablove, and I am a Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Michigan](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), studying under [Prof. Roya Ensafi](https://censoredplanet.org/team). My research centers on network security and Internet freedom, particularly at the intersection of computer science, policy, and human rights. Generally, I focus on topics such as network measurement, censorship/geoblocking, and the integration of user perspectives. More recently, I've been interested in how big tech can aid Internet accessibility and transparency.
